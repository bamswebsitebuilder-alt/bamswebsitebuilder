# Agreement verification

The agreement rules use a separate `users/{uid}/agreements/{id}` collection. Issued quotes are fixed records. Only the assigned verified account may create its single acceptance receipt, and that receipt cannot be edited or deleted. Admins may withdraw an unaccepted quote but cannot rewrite it or fabricate a client acceptance.

The owner prepares actual project details under Admin → Projects → Client quotes and agreements. Issue confirms the provider's terms; the client then reviews and accepts under Portal → Agreements. This does not collect payment. Each record stores the complete versioned terms text, keeping later policy changes from altering an issued quote. Never overwrite `project-terms-v1.json` for a new terms version; add a new version and update the model and rules deliberately.

The security tests require Node, Java 21+, Firebase CLI, `firebase`, and `@firebase/rules-unit-testing`. Run them against an isolated demo project with the Firestore emulator, never against production:

```
firebase emulators:exec --only firestore --project demo-bam-agreements "node tests/agreement-rules.test.mjs"
```

Browser acceptance was also verified with nonbinding localhost fixtures against the isolated emulator using the production transaction and renderer. Those temporary browser fixtures are kept outside the published repository.
